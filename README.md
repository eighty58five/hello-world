# hello-world
Just another repository
I am exploring code so I can use it in everyday life, work and help teach my children.

2020_12_29 I have now successfully edited and flashed my own keyboard an ANSI HS60/v2.
Now looking to create some custom macro's so revisitng GIT to review other peoples keymaps for some guidance and insipration.
